# Time resolved gas-phase/liquid-phase electron-diffraction data analysis
This repository contains all the data analysis scripts used for the processing, cleaning and analysis of the electron diffraction images which were taken as part of my PhD project in Max-Planck Institute for the structure and dynamics of matter. 

Since majority of the work is part of a manuscript, updated notebooks will be made public as soon as possible.

An example of the simulated electron diffraction pattern:
